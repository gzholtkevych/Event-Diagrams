<H1>Clocks</H1>

%% insert note text below %%

Here, we consider **clocks** as identifiers of system components that trigger events and observe ones.

Introducing the concept of a clock provides a manner to consider the space-time view of the system's behavior (see for example, [L. Lamport](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf)).

>[!important] We assume that the set of clocks
