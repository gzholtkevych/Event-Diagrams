A distributed computation is one of the most used kinds of computation today.
It is caused by the main trend of modern Information Technology namely, the migration of data processing to clouds.

A distributed computation is characterized by the following

2. each participant is a [[Sequential Computation|sequential computational process]] performed by its own processor equipped with isolated memory;
3. the participants' processors are networking and interact by message-passing via this network only.
