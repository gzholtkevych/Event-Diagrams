<H1>Events</H1>

%% insert note text below %%

An **event** is an atomic change happening in the system being considered that is significant from the point of view of the studying aspect of the system behavior.
Events are triggered or observed by *system components*.

>[!important] Here, we assume that
> an event is triggered or observed by *exactly one* system component that is referred to as the *source* of this event.

>[!important] Also, we assume that
>events of the same source are *linearly ordered* by their local time of occurrences, and this order turns their set into *finite or the first infinite ordinal*.
