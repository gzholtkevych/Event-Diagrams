<H1>Events</H1>

%% insert note text below %%

An **event** is an atomic change that occurs in the system being considered and is important from the point of view of the studied aspect of the system behavior.
Given that an event occurs instantaneously, we characterize it as a point (called a **point-event**) wich coordinates are the identifier of participant watching this event and timestamp of this event from that participant point of view as coordinates.
Usually, the participant identifier is related to the location where an event happened, and the timestamp is related to the timepoint when the event happened.
A point-event are attributed if it is necessary with additional properties.

>[!important] Here, we assume that
> an event is triggered or observed by *exactly one* system component that is referred to as the *source* of this event.

>[!important] Also, we assume that
>events of the same source are *linearly ordered* by their local time of occurrences, and this order turns their set into *finite or the first infinite ordinal*.
